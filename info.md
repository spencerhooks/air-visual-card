# Shooks Air Visual Card

![example](https://github.com/spencerhooks/shooks-air-visual-card/blob/master/images/example.PNG)

This is a Home Assistant Lovelace card that uses a local sensor to provide air quality index (AQI) data and creates a card like the ones found on [AirVisual website](https://www.airvisual.com). Requires a local AQI sensor. Tested with Plantower PMS5003 sensors running on ESPHome nodes.

Forked from https://github.com/dnguyen800

## Features
  - Card color and icons change depending on AQI level
  - Icons can be locally hosted or defaults to jsdelivr.net
